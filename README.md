First project for CompSci 308 Spring 2015
//Note that I worked on the project in the CopiedExample folder rather //than the final folder, which is called TheGame.

Name: Danny Oh

Date started: 1/9/15

Date finished: 1/16/15

Hours worked: 20 hours

Resources used: Ballworld

Main class file: TheGame/Main.java

Data (non Java) files needed: TheGame/images/But.gif
TheGame/images/hand.png
TheGame/images/Poop.gif
TheGame/images/shot.png

How to play the game: Shoot the butt until its HP goes down. Make sure you do not run out of ammo or lose too much HP by getting hit by the poop! Also, finish before time runs out.

Keys/Mouse input: Click to shoot, A to move left, D to move right

Cheat Keys: I for invincibility, W for instant win (level1 win goes to level 2 immediately), L for instant loss, and M for infinite ammo

Known bugs: None.

Extra features: None(?) I mean, it has an ammo counter and timer too... what more could you want? ;)

Impressions/Suggestions: Certain things are quite hard to figure out- how to stop frame updating (how to transition to a new screen in general). I think a guide on these most difficult things would be helpful. Other than that, the assignment was a blast.
