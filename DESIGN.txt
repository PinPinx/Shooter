Genre: Top Down Shooter
Game Name: Pain in the Butt
Goal: Given a limited amount of time, shoot the butt moving laterally at the
top of the screen using a hand that moves laterally at the bottom of the screen
. The butt dies once it has been shot enough times by hands that you can shoot.
However, you die if you have been shot enough times by poop that shoots at you.
Kill the butt before it kills you.
Basic mechanics: A to move left, D to move right, click to shoot.
How hard level differs: In easy mode, the poop shoots straight down. In hard
mode, the poop shoots at you, and the shots you shoot are affected by the 
direction you are moving in.
